# Diversification exercise

To do the exercise, fork this, clone your fork to your computer, make changes to diversification.Rmd, knit it (to create output), `git commit -m"my homework is done" -a` them, `git push`, and then in github make a pull request. See [https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/](this) for how to do this.
